# Podcast Pals

> A podcast is an episodic series of digital audio or video files which a user can download and listen to. It is often available for subscription, so that new episodes are automatically downloaded via web syndication to the user's own local computer, mobile application, or portable media player. (Definition via Wikipedia)

PODCAST PALS is a web app where users can discover new podcasts. You will be able to keep track of what your friends listen to and also share your favorite podcasts.
